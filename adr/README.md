# Architectural Design Record

As someone who has been working in webdev for a while now, my goal for this project will be to explore new languages and
technologies that I haven't used before or want a deeper understanding of, as well as feasibility within the project's
time constraints as well as adequacy to the task at hand.
The options I will present might not be backed by frivolous research, but more through endorsement of peers and the
community (like the StackOverflow or State of JS surveys).

So far, the technologies and frameworks I have used and won't consider for this project include frontend frameworks like
React and Vue, Backend/MVC frameworks like Laravel and Next.js, and MySQL and PostgreSQL for databases.

I will be using this document to keep track of the decisions I make and the reasons behind them.
